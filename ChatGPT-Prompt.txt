Prompt: generating a catalogue (toc) file

Context:
I have a screenshot of a scanned version of a book with a table of contents. The requirement is to collate the table of contents information into a text file in a specific syntax format. The requirement is that the content must be complete, including all chapters, sub-chapters and page numbers, and that the hierarchy is distinguished by indentation. If the table of contents has page number offsets or other special commands (e.g. ‘+10’), these need to be preserved as well.

Example of a table of contents format (toc format):
```toc
# This is a comment
First Chapter 1
    first section 1
        first subsection 1
    second section 4
    third section 5

+Second Chapter 10

Second Chapter 10
    The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
    some entry 11
```

Requirements:
	1. please read the text directly from the scanned screenshot of the table of contents without extracting it by writing code;
	2. complete all chapters (including previously omitted Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7) as well as subsequent chapters and appendices according to the contents of the table of contents shown in the image;
	3. keep the level of entries clear, make sure that the chapter titles, sub-chapter titles and page numbers are correct;
	4. The format of the output text should strictly comply with the above toc format requirements;

Please generate a complete catalogue toc file according to the above requirements.

You can restart the same task next time by just copying and pasting the above prompt. I hope this organisation will be helpful to you!
